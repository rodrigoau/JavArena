## 🚀 Course Overview
The goal of this repository is not just to teach Java syntax, but to teach you how to **think** like a software engineer. Here you will find heavily commented code, practical exercises, and explanations covering:
- Programming logic and control flow.
- The Object-Oriented Paradigm (OOP).
- Efficient Data Management (Java Collections Framework).
- Search and Sort Algorithms with complexity analysis.
